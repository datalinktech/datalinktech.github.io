          <h2 class="section-heading">GPS Tracking Systems</h2>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink Technologies offer a wide range of fleet management solutions for GPS Vehicle and Asset Tracking systems, tailored to suit each individual clients specific needs.
          </p>

          <p class="lead"><b>Vehicle & Asset Tracking</b></p>

          <p class="lead">
            At the heart of Datalink's GPS Vehicle Tracking technology is the MegaTrack, designed and built by Datalink, which contains a GPS module to determine location from the Global Positioning System (GPS satellite system) and a cellular telephone modem.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">MegaTrak uses the GSM cellular phone network's GPRS data feature as the method of data communication because of its extensive coverage and economical cost.</p>

          <p class="lead">The modem sends this data to Datalink's secure web servers.  The vehicle location information is available to authorised users, permitted access through individual, secure usernames and passwords.</p>

          <p class="lead">
            Should a vehicle, or asset, move out of network range, MegaTak stores the location reports and delivers them when the vehicle returns into range.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink's system partition each fleet so that users can only see their fleet's vehicles, or assets.  Logging onto the website from anywhere in the world provides great flexibility to customers with offices in various locations, or for after-hours fleet monitoring from home.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Our Vehicle and Asset Tracking website (DFMS) consists of a live tracking page and a historical page.  The live tracking page shows the real-time location and status of each vehicle or asset, displayed as an icon on a map.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Coverage is Australia-wide, and maps can zoom-in to a single road, or location and zoom-out to state and national levels.  MegaTrak is programmed to report its' current position every few minutes and or, when it has travelled a specific distance.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The historical facility creates location reports, available for replay.  The user can ask for a historical presentation of where a vehicle, or asset, travelled over a particular time-frame, as a trail on a map, or as text, reporting activity such as, time, date, street address location, ignition-status and speed.  The historical facility allows the user to observe the time and route a vehicle, or asset has travelled and when and where it stopped.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The Datalink system also offer extensive options, such as:Cargo Temerature Monitoring, Covert Driver Duress Alert for when a driver is under threat, Door Open/close Transitions etc. These conditions can send an SMS alert or email, wheneveran event occurs.
          </p>

          <p class="lead"><b>Personal Tracking</b></p>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink provides a system for personnel tracking called AlertTrak, which is a portable version of the Vehicle & Asset Tracking system.  This system uses the same web servers for user access and the same alerting features.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">AlertTrak is a device carried on the person requiring tracking.  AlertTrak is simple to use, with only two user buttons.  One is for alert of duress and the other enables the user to call a single, chosen destination.  The possible applications for AlertTrak are endless and vary from, lone worker emergency assistance, to duress alert, to traacking of invalid, or aged persons</p>

          <p class="lead">ALertTrack can be programmed to regularly report the location of the person carrying the device.  AlertTrak is powered by a rechargeable battery.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Fleet Management Solutions</h2>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink creates a range of fleet management solutions to simplify and enhance the business processes used within the transport industry.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Our systems are designed and engineered, after close consultation with the client, to ensure that the systems we create fulfill the needs of each individual transport operator and provide the maximum benefits in improved business efficiencies.
          </p>

          <h3>Job Dispatch Systems</h3>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink's Job Dispatch systems electronically send job details, as text, to a terminal in each vehicle.  Job details typically consists of a number of fields of text, such as:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Consignor Name</li>
            <li>Pick Up Name and Address</li>
            <li>Description of Freight</li>
            <li>Notes regarding the job or freight</li>
            <li>Drop off Name and Address</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink's Job Dispatch system transfers job details, in real time, as text, from a dispatch operator to a specific vehicle's terminal device.  The electronic dispatch process saves considerable time and eliminates errors when drivers don't acknowledge job details correctly.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The electronic terminal device in the vehicle enables the driver, when required, to send progress confirmation back to the transport operator.  The driver sends status messages from a pre-programmed list such as: picked up, dropped off, etc, or may send personal status message such as: stuck in traffic, meal break, rest period etc.  The list can be endless and tailored to suit each individual company's needs.
          </p>

          <h3>Fatigue Management</h3>

          <p class="lead">
            The demanding requirements of OH&S Fatigue Mangement implementation, coupled with the Chain of Responsibility legislation, have many linehaul transport operators struggling with complex paper-based systems to ensure that drivers comply with their requirements regarding OH&S and Fatigue Management responsibilities.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            These systems are time consuming and generate large paper trails that have to be checked, filed and stored for a considerable time period.  Filing is a labour intensive and expensive exercise for many operators and can quickly become a full-time clerical position.  Storage of these records is also a substantial issue.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink has developed an electronic system to replace these paper-based systems.  Datalink's Fatigue Management system uses a driver terminal screen in the vehicle to enable the driver to enter details of their trip planning and to also complete an electronic vehicle roadworthiness inspection checklist.  Each driver is provided with a key-ring tag, which is used to verify the driver identity.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            It also allows the driver to report any vehicle defects, or report any driver injury, during their trip.  All details are sent electronically to the transport manager as soon as entered and are available for immediately scrutiny.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink's Megatrak GPS module is attached to the terminal and allows the driver's trip-plan to be verified against actual driver behaviour, as well as confirming the location and time of the driver's entry.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Records are emailed to the transport operator, who can store them electronically for rapid recall, or choose to print them as paper records, if required, at a later date.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Service Industry Solutions</h2>

          <p class="lead">
            Service industries, by nature of the tasks performed, require detailed accounting of a field job, including parts, labour used and date time location details to keep track of the business processes. Typically, this is carried out by service technicians using paper based job sheets.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            This paper process presents a number of management problems. Job sheets are handed in weekly or even later and can be lost, contain errors, and/or don't record all parts used.  This leads to lost profits, due to uncharged parts and a considerable time lag between job completion and invoicing.  Queried or disputed jobs are further delayed with a negative impact on cash-flow.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            In partnership with Baseplan Software Systems P/L, we have developed a seamless electronic system to replace the traditional paper-based job sheet. As work on-site progresses, all job related information is wirelessly scanned into an in-van technician terminal, including parts and materials.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The completed job is immediately sent to the customers back-end office system, supplied by Baseplan.  The parts or materials used information enables automatic inventory reconciliation and van stock replenishment
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            A printer allows an invoice or job advice to be given to the customer on-site.  The technician moves quickly on to the next customer.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Your company benefits from the ability to invoice your client as soon as the job is completed, considerably enhancing cash-flow.  Savings are made on eliminating data entry labour and customer queries or disputes can be resolved before the worker leaves the site.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Customer relations are smoother and account staff are less likely be exposed to lengthy, costly and damaging disputes with customers.

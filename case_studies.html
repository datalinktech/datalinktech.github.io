          <h2 class="section-heading">JSS Logistics</h2>

          <p class="lead">
            JSS Logistics Pty Ltd is a specialised transport and Logistics company operating in WA. Their transport services extend throughout WA and the NT with 30 heavy vehicles operating up and down the seaboard and interior of Western Australia, delivering into some of the most remotest parts of Australia.  Their loads are time sensitive and mostly delivered to isolated destinations, consequently it was imperative for them to know where their drivers/loads were at all times to meet customer needs and ensure the safety of their drivers particularly when they are out of GSM cov-erage.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink worked with JSS Logistics Pilbara to provide the most cost effective solutions to the above business challenges.  Their local vehicles were fitted with the Datalink MegaTrak V3.2 GPS track-ing unit and their line haul vehicles with Datalink’s In Vehicle Messaging Unit with satellite  (IVMS) providing them with the messaging and navigation features they required and an unprecedented level of connectivity using the Iridium satellite service in non GSM areas.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The Datalink IVMS system enables the driver to be sent messages/job details that is displayed on their In Vehicle screen.  The driver is able to respond with any queries, updates or simply advise their status back to the Datalink Fleet Management System (DFMS) of their current status i.e. trav-elling, loading, unloading, resting etc.  All information is sent back electronically via GSM or in JSS Logistics’ case also by satellite.  Each driver has a unique login so that driver history is recorded.  The system also allows for broadcast messages to be sent from the DFMS to advise of traffic haz-ards, weather, fire updates etc.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Another major benefit of the IVMS is that in an emergency a driver can send a Breakdown or Emergency Alert which is received via email/sms notification to nominated personnel that they re-quire assistance.  The date, location and link with actual position is sent with the message, giving management piece of mind after hours, in or out of GSM coverage that their staff are not alone.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink’s  online mapping product, the DFMS allows JSS Logistics Pilbara to know exactly where all their vehicles are in real time 24/7. The DFMS provides various reports including distance trav-elled, time on site, driver hours and location reports allowing mangers to re-route, train, cross ref-erence billable hours and ensure drivers are meeting compliance regulations.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Further enhancements were made at the request of JSS and a Service and Maintenance feature was implemented to alert JSS when their vehicles are due for maintenance and a Bonnet Lift fea-ture developed to allow JSS to record when the bonnet has been opened and closed with regards ongoing maintenance.

Lencrow exclusively sells Nissan Forklift Trucks, Unicarrier, Fantuzzi (shipping) Container Handling Equipment and EP Equipment. Lencrow services and maintains all brands of fork-lifts and operates a hire service with in excess of 2500 machines.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The Lencrow Materials Handling Group attributes its success to its focus on quality, value for money, adaptability to industry advancements and its focus on building long lasting relation-ships. These core values which were set down when the Company commenced business are still embraced today.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Lencrow installed the Datalink Technologies Field Service Mobile (FSM) Platform in 2006 achieving very real productivity gains as a result. Lencrow is now transitioning to the latest Datalink Field Service Mobility platform utilising the Panasonic Toughpad a ruggedised Tab-let with enhanced capabilities. Lencrow also tracks its service vans with Datalink’s MegaTrak units linked to the Datalink Mapper.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Lencrow expanded its operations late in 2014 through the acquisition of Powerlift a Nissan Forklift Trucks distributor. Lencrow wanted Powerlift to quickly embrace the existing Lencrow Service Job Handling system processes and chose Datalink's Field Service Mobility Tablet solution to introduce into the Powerlift team.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The ‘brief’ was to deploy the Tablet system into the 25 Powerlift vans nationally using Len-crow's existing processes with the added functionality of PDF store and read on the Tablet including ‘signature capture’ email ability and picture capture.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink designed their new Tablet solution software to be ‘backward’ compatible with the existing Datalink Field Service Technician IVT (In-Vehicle Terminal) software being used by Lencrow. This enabled Lencrow to rollout the latest Tablet offering from Datalink in accor-dance with their immediate business needs and budgets.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            With this latest Tablet version of Datalink’s FSM solution Lencrow is able to achieve their rollout requirements of their new business while continuing uninterrupted with their existing business’s Field Service Technician needs.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Liftrite</h2>

          <p class="lead">
            LIftRite is a Hire & Sales company that was founded in Perth in 1983 as a West Australian owned and operated specialist provider of world-class materials handling solutions to the con-struction, mining and agricultural industries.  From humble beginnings they have grown to em-ploy more than 70 sales, hire and service professionals and support staff.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            LiftRite has been a customer of Elev8 Australia for the last 6 years using their InspHire ERP system. Enjoying tremendous growth, LiftRite knew that an efficient, tried and tested Hire, Rental Asset Management system was needed to take them to the next level and beyond. LiftRite’s contacts in the industry were more than willing to recommend InspHire ERP System. Making the choice to proceed with implementing InspHire was made simple and risk free with Elev8’s sup-port. Six years later LiftRite continue to enjoy the benefits of increased proficiency and produc-tivity in using InspHire to control day to day activities. LiftRite have seen the many enhance-ments and improvements of the InspHire Corporate product that continues to improve as a result of InspHire’s dedication to R&D.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            In 2014 LiftRite were investigating the concept of introducing a Field Service Mobility solution to their Field Service team to streamline their job handling abilities and dispense with their current labour intensive, costly paper based processes.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Elev8 Australia and Datalink Technologies, a specialist in Field Service Mobility solutions, were well down the track of a joint development of exactly that solution using Datalink’s expertise in Field Service mobility solutions to interface their FSM application with Elev8’s InspHire ERP system.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            LiftRite then contracted Datalink and Elev8 Australia to produce their desired FSM solution.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            At the field end Datalink’s solution uses the Panasonic Toughpad ruggedised Tablet with en-hanced capabilities. LiftRite wanted the van treated as a warehouse which aligns with the busi-ness practice philosophy applied by Datalink and Elev8. Importantly the vehicles are fitted with dedicated in-vehicle trackers ensuring control over the assets of both vehicle and stock and total visibility of the technician/job/site/vehicle relationship.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Jobs are allocated to the technician’s unique identity in the InspHire system and when the tech-nician logs on to his Tablet he receives all allocated jobs. When these are read he follows a rigid process from ‘accepted’ through to completion. On job completion all of the job data is sent back to InspHire.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink’s solutions suited LiftRite well as they provide all aspects of their requirements including interface and integration to their InspHire ERP system and the ‘field’ needs from service application software and hardware, tracking software and hardware and installation and mounting hardware
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The combination of the Elev8 InspHire ERP system and Datalink’s Field Service Mobility solu-tion with Vehicle Tracking ensures that LiftRite remains in total control of its business process operations and at the fore in the Hire & Sale market.

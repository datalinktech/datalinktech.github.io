          <h2 class="section-heading">JSS Logistics</h2>

          <p class="lead">
            JSS Logistics Pty Ltd is a specialised transport and Logistics company operating in WA. Their transport services extend throughout WA and the NT with 30 heavy vehicles operating up and down the seaboard and interior of Western Australia, delivering into some of the most remotest parts of Australia.  Their loads are time sensitive and mostly delivered to isolated destinations, consequently it was imperative for them to know where their drivers/loads were at all times to meet customer needs and ensure the safety of their drivers particularly when they are out of GSM coverage.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink worked with JSS Logistics Pilbara to provide the most cost effective solutions to the above business challenges.  Their local vehicles were fitted with the Datalink MegaTrak V3.2 GPS tracking unit and their line haul vehicles with Datalink’s In Vehicle Messaging Unit with satellite  (IVMS) providing them with the messaging and navigation features they required and an unprecedented level of connectivity using the Iridium satellite service in non GSM areas.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The Datalink IVMS system enables the driver to be sent messages/job details that is displayed on their In Vehicle screen.  The driver is able to respond with any queries, updates or simply advise their status back to the Datalink Fleet Management System (DFMS) of their current status i.e. travelling, loading, unloading, resting etc.  All information is sent back electronically via GSM or in JSS Logistics’ case also by satellite.  Each driver has a unique login so that driver history is recorded.  The system also allows for broadcast messages to be sent from the DFMS to advise of traffic hazards, weather, fire updates etc.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Another major benefit of the IVMS is that in an emergency a driver can send a Breakdown or Emergency Alert which is received via email/sms notification to nominated personnel that they require assistance.  The date, location and link with actual position is sent with the message, giving management piece of mind after hours, in or out of GSM coverage that their staff are not alone.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink’s  online mapping product, the DFMS allows JSS Logistics Pilbara to know exactly where all their vehicles are in real time 24/7. The DFMS provides various reports including distance travelled, time on site, driver hours and location reports allowing mangers to re-route, train, cross reference billable hours and ensure drivers are meeting compliance regulations.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Further enhancements were made at the request of JSS and a Service and Maintenance feature was implemented to alert JSS when their vehicles are due for maintenance and a Bonnet Lift feature developed to allow JSS to record when the bonnet has been opened and closed with regards ongoing maintenance.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Lencrow</h2>

          <p class="lead">
            <a href="http://www.lencrowforklifts.com.au/">Lencrow</a> is a Materials Handling company that commenced business in Sydney in 1976. Lencrow exclusively sells Nissan Forklift Trucks, Unicarrier, Fantuzzi (shipping) Container Handling Equipment and EP Equipment. Lencrow services and maintains all brands of forklifts and operates a hire service with in excess of 2500 machines.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The Lencrow Materials Handling Group attributes its success to its focus on quality, value for money, adaptability to industry advancements and its focus on building long lasting relationships. These core values which were set down when the Company commenced business are still embraced today.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Lencrow installed the Datalink Technologies Field Service Mobile (FSM) Platform in 2006 achieving very real productivity gains as a result. Lencrow is now transitioning to the latest Datalink Field Service Mobility platform utilising the Panasonic Toughpad a ruggedised Tablet with enhanced capabilities. Lencrow also tracks its service vans with Datalink’s MegaTrak units linked to the Datalink Mapper.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Lencrow expanded its operations late in 2014 through the acquisition of Powerlift a Nissan Forklift Trucks distributor. Lencrow wanted Powerlift to quickly embrace the existing Lencrow Service Job Handling system processes and chose Datalink's Field Service Mobility Tablet solution to introduce into the Powerlift team.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The ‘brief’ was to deploy the Tablet system into the 25 Powerlift vans nationally using Lencrow's existing processes with the added functionality of PDF store and read on the Tablet including ‘signature capture’ email ability and picture capture.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink designed their new Tablet solution software to be ‘backward’ compatible with the existing Datalink Field Service Technician IVT (In-Vehicle Terminal) software being used by Lencrow. This enabled Lencrow to rollout the latest Tablet offering from Datalink in accordance with their immediate business needs and budgets.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            With this latest Tablet version of Datalink’s FSM solution Lencrow is able to achieve their rollout requirements of their new business while continuing uninterrupted with their existing business’s Field Service Technician needs.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Liftrite</h2>

          <p class="lead">
            <a href="http://www.liftrite.com.au/">LiftRite</a> is a Hire & Sales company that was founded in Perth in 1983 as a West Australian owned and operated specialist provider of world-class materials handling solutions to the construction, mining and agricultural industries.  From humble beginnings they have grown to employ more than 70 sales, hire and service professionals and support staff.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            LiftRite has been a customer of Elev8 Australia for the last 6 years using their InspHire ERP system. Enjoying tremendous growth, LiftRite knew that an efficient, tried and tested Hire, Rental Asset Management system was needed to take them to the next level and beyond. LiftRite’s contacts in the industry were more than willing to recommend InspHire ERP System. Making the choice to proceed with implementing InspHire was made simple and risk free with Elev8’s support. Six years later LiftRite continue to enjoy the benefits of increased proficiency and productivity in using InspHire to control day to day activities. LiftRite have seen the many enhancements and improvements of the InspHire Corporate product that continues to improve as a result of InspHire’s dedication to R&D.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            In 2014 LiftRite were investigating the concept of introducing a Field Service Mobility solution to their Field Service team to streamline their job handling abilities and dispense with their current labour intensive, costly paper based processes.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Elev8 Australia and Datalink Technologies, a specialist in Field Service Mobility solutions, were well down the track of a joint development of exactly that solution using Datalink’s expertise in Field Service mobility solutions to interface their FSM application with Elev8’s InspHire ERP system.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            LiftRite then contracted Datalink and Elev8 Australia to produce their desired FSM solution.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            At the field end Datalink’s solution uses the Panasonic Toughpad ruggedised Tablet with enhanced capabilities. LiftRite wanted the van treated as a warehouse which aligns with the business practice philosophy applied by Datalink and Elev8. Importantly the vehicles are fitted with dedicated in-vehicle trackers ensuring control over the assets of both vehicle and stock and total visibility of the technician/job/site/vehicle relationship.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Jobs are allocated to the technician’s unique identity in the InspHire system and when the technician logs on to his Tablet he receives all allocated jobs. When these are read he follows a rigid process from ‘accepted’ through to completion. On job completion all of the job data is sent back to InspHire.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Datalink’s solutions suited LiftRite well as they provide all aspects of their requirements including interface and integration to their InspHire ERP system and the ‘field’ needs from service application software and hardware, tracking software and hardware and installation and mounting hardware
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The combination of the Elev8 InspHire ERP system and Datalink’s Field Service Mobility solution with Vehicle Tracking ensures that LiftRite remains in total control of its business process operations and at the fore in the Hire & Sale market.

            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Since 2004 In-vehicle Terminal (IVT) and In-Workshop Terminal (IWT) solutions provided by leading Field Service Mobility (FSM) system provider, Datalink Technologies in combination with the Baseplan ERP system has helped maximise Linde’s efficiency here.

              Linde field service technicians have a streamlined and user friendly process, removing their need for the majority of the paperwork previously required, with increased labour and parts usage recording accuracy.

            <p class="lead">
              The application software retains its user friendly roots from 2004 which makes it familiar and intuitive to field personnel while bringing tablet features that enhance the user experience.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Datalink designed the new tablet solution software to be ‘backward’ compatible with existing software on Datalink IVT units being used by Linde.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              This enabled Linde planners to rollout the latest tablet offering from Datalink in accordance with their own controlled budget plans.

            <p class="lead">
              The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (<a href="http://rspcavic.org/">RSPCA - Victoria</a>) is a non-government, community based charity that works to prevent cruelty to animals by actively promoting their care and protection.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Across the state, the RSPCA's community services include the work undertaken by their Inspectorate, Animal Shelters, Clinics and Education teams.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Datalink’s product solutions assist RSPCA Inspectors who work tirelessly to protect animals from cruelty, investigating thousands of reports, prosecuting offenders and rescuing animals from dangerous situations across Victoria.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Ensuring the safety of their employees was paramount to the RSPCA.  Accordingly Inspectors vehicles were fitted with Trunked Two Way Radios operating on the Telstra Statewide Mobile Radio (SMR) network providing them with coverage over 96% of Victoria’s landmass. With greater coverage, they were able to help protect the health and safety of their mobile workforce with confidence that their calls would get through when they need it most.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              The RSPCA later deployed GPS tracking to their inspectorate vehicles.  The provision of GPS Tracking provides essential information allowing the RSPCA to manage staff progress and safety, in real time and also provides a full history of where the vehicles have been.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              As the vehicles travel throughout the whole of Victoria  it also makes it easy for operations to re route their staff incases of emergency such as bushfires by being able to see them in real time.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              The RSPCA also utilise the Odometer feature on the Datalink Fleet Management System (DFMS) to keep track of the maintenance and servicing of their vehicles.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Tobin Brothers</h2>

            <p class="lead">
              <a href="http://www.tobinbrothers.com.au/">Tobin Brothers</a> was founded by brothers Leo, Phonse, Thomas and Kevin Tobin in 1934 and  has a long and proud history of providing high levels of service and care to their client families.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              The company began with its first branch in North Melbourne, which is still head office today. The Company’s branch network now spreads to 22 locations across Melbourne and Victoria.  Over the last 9 decades of operations Tobin Brothers fleet needs have expanded to a specialist range of 70 company vehicles.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Tobin Brothers once described their operational challenges as being one of logistics, whereby operations and their coordinators have a total dependancy on and commitment to a) receipt of accurate information, b) meeting time sensitive events, c) timely coordination of their available resources.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              The above needs include managing this large fleet and coordination with their 22 branches and other event based locations and persons. To achieve that aim, rigorous control is required, efficient reliable communications and real time visibility of the fleet and personnel movements are essential.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              In 2008 Tobin Brothers engaged Datalink to provide a solution to meet these needs. The Datalink solution comprised using Trunked Radio units on the Telstra SMR (Statewide Mobile Radio) network for voice and Datalink’s MegaTrak GPS unit for the tracking requirements.  Additionally Tobin Brothers required transparency of which personnel were in which vehicle at any given time. This requirement was met by Datalink using a RFID Reader interfaced to the Tracker unit and personnel Tags.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              The person driving the vehicle is required whenever the ignition is switched on to swipe their personnel Tag recording their unique identity back to the DFMS. This delivers an important relationship back to operations of vehicle/driver/job location and timing.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Large screens are connected to the Datalink Fleet Management System (DFMS) in their operations rooms allowing dispatch controllers to see the real time activity of all of their fleets movements.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Future plans include the provision by Datalink of an in-vehicle messaging system for selected vehicles. This system enables operations to send job details to these vehicles through the Datalink Fleet Management System and drivers can respond with relevant status inputs and messages

              <h2 class="section-heading">VICMIX</h2>

              <p class="lead">
                <a href="http://www.vicmix.com.au/">VICMIX</a> is a thriving concrete company with more than 60 concrete, tipper and tanker trucks, employing over 50 people at three sites in Dandenong, Pakenham, and Coburg.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                VICMIX consider themselves... "a Transport Company first and a Concrete Company second"... among their core values is the accurate manufacture and efficient dispatch, delivery and management of their customers orders load after load, reliably on time which has become inextricably linked to the capabilities of the Mixer Truck.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                Managing a fleet of this size from 3 sites requires rigorous control, to achieve that aim, efficient reliable communications and real time visibility of the fleets movements are essential.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                In 2008 VICMIX engaged Datalink to provide a solution to meet these needs. The Datalink solution comprised Trunked Radios on the Telstra SMR (Statewide Mobile Radio) network for voice and Datalink’s MegaTrak GPS tracking units for their tracking requirements.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                The radios operate on a ‘business’ based, highly reliable purpose built network with coverage across 96% of Victoria’s landmass so as VICMIX expands, their needs are already covered. The Datalink Fleet Management System (DFMS) provides a 24/7 tracking system using GSM networks.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                The MegaTrak GPS unit is permanently powered providing 24/7 visibility in real time with current and historical reporting on the vehicles travel, status and events. VICMIX’s Dispatching team run a ‘high visibility’ wide screen in the operations room on which all dispatch controllers can see the real time activity of all their Concrete Truck fleet movements.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                VICMIX’s voice and tracking requirements are purposely on independent networks to ensure fallback provision of either function in the event of the radio or GSM network being temporarily unavailable.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                This approach to VICMIX’s needs has ensured that any expansion of the business is catered for in these two critical functions without interruption to their core business
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                Future plans include the provision by Datalink of an interface to VICMIX’s dispatching software system to provide real time loading, delivery, unloading update status of the trucks.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                This combination of Voice and GPS Vehicle Tracking ensures that VICMIX remains in complete control of its operations and at the forefront in its market.

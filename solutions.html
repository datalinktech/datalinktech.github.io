          <p class="lead">
            Datalink's Field Service Fixed In Vehicle Terminal (IVT) Solution makes moving from traditional paper based processes to fully automated real time electronic solutions easy!
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The IVT permits job details to be sent electronically to a serviceman.  The solution can be interfaced to most back end office systems eliminating the traditional paper based service job sheet.  All job information can be entered on site so when the job is completed the serviceman enters in time spent, work completed, scans the parts used and prints a record of the work carried out.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            All of the job information is sent electronically to the back end system in real time.  Thus the time cycle from job completion to the customer receiving an invoice is greatly reduced.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Additionally Datalink’s in house software team is able to customise the terminal operation to be-spoke customer requirements.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The IVT job handling process is fully supported with Datalink’s 3G tracking functionality. This pro-vides time date location information for the jobs as well as real time vehicle tracking and historical reporting of vehicle related events via the Web based DFMS (Datalink Fleet Management System.)

          <h2 class="section-heading">Service Industry Solutions</h2>

          <p class="lead">
            Service industries, by nature of the tasks performed, require detailed accounting of a field job, including parts, labour used and date time location details to keep track of the business processes. Typically, this is carried out by service technicians using paper based job sheets.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            This paper process presents a number of management problems. Job sheets are handed in weekly or even later and can be lost, contain errors, and/or don't record all parts used.  This leads to lost profits, due to uncharged parts and a considerable time lag between job completion and invoicing.  Queried or disputed jobs are further delayed with a negative impact on cash-flow.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            In partnership with Baseplan Software Systems P/L, we have developed a seamless electronic system to replace the traditional paper-based job sheet. As work on-site progresses, all job related information is wirelessly scanned into an in-van technician terminal, including parts and materials.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            The completed job is immediately sent to the customers back-end office system, supplied by Baseplan.  The parts or materials used information enables automatic inventory reconciliation and van stock replenishment
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            A printer allows an invoice or job advice to be given to the customer on-site.  The technician moves quickly on to the next customer.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Your company benefits from the ability to invoice your client as soon as the job is completed, considerably enhancing cash-flow.  Savings are made on eliminating data entry labour and customer queries or disputes can be resolved before the worker leaves the site.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Customer relations are smoother and account staff are less likely be exposed to lengthy, costly and damaging disputes with customers.
